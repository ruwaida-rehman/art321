    <p>
        <b><u>Address</u><br>
            This looks simple, and it is, but don't just fill in your current address and then forget about it.<br>
            If your address changes, make sure you tell UCAS immediately – including your email address and mobile/telephone number.
        </b>
        <ul>
            <li>UCAS will automatically notify your university choices of the change. <br>
                If you don't keep UCAS informed of your change of address you will find letters and emails (which might be offers or a confirmation of a place) go to the wrong address.
            </li>
            <li>If you are at boarding school tell UCAS when you go home for the summer. </li>
            <li>It is essential to keep UCAS informed of any changes to your email address. <br>
                The majority of communication from universities will be by email (open day details, accommodation reminders, news,
                and even an offer of a place or alternative offer in Clearing).</li>
            <li>Make sure your email inbox can receive bulk emails and is not full, especially during results time in August. <br>
                You may not use email much but Universities do!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b><u>Examination results</u><br>
            It is important to ensure you get the details of the exams which you are due to be taking exactly right.
            <br></b>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are taking English Language and Literature, put the full title and not just English, even if everyone in your school or college calls it English.</li>
            <li>This is important because any mistakes could mean that UCAS cannot match your application with your examination results straightaway in the summer. <br>This could result in a unnecessary delay in universities making their decisions.</li>
            <li>Listing the full module details of a BTEC award is also important to avoid confusion over precisely what subjects you have studied.</li>
            <li>If you are taking the examinations of another country do not try to give a UK equivalent. <br>Always state exactly what you are doing and let the university decide the equivalence so as to avoid any confusion.</li>
            <li>If the column headings on the form are inappropriate, then ignore them.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <b>Be honest. Never be tempted to massage your results to make them look a little better.</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li>UCAS has some extremely sophisticated fraud-busting techniques and admissions tutors are remarkably good at spotting rogue applications.</li>
            <li>If you are found to be giving false or incomplete information, you will be promptly ejected from UCAS and lose any chance of a place at university that year.</li>
            <li>Even if you manage to slip through all the detection devices, you are likely to be asked by the university to present your certificates. Any sign of tampering will be investigated with the examining board.</li>
            <li>When the examination board advises your would-be university that the ABB on your form was really DDD, you will politely be shown the door.</li>
        </ul>
        <b><u>Personal statement</u><br>
            This is your chance to say anything you like, in your own words, to persuade admissions tutors that yours is the brightest and best application ever to have crossed their desk.
            <br>You can write what you like. The key areas to include:
        </b>
        <ul>
            <li>Why you want to study your chosen subject.</li>
            <li>What particular qualities and experience you can bring to the course.</li>
            <li>Details of any work experience or voluntary activity, especially if it is relevant to your course.</li>
            <li>Any other evidence of extracurricular achievements.</li>
            <li>Details of any sponsorship or placements you have secured or applied for.</li>
            <li>Your career aspirations.</li>
            <li>Any wider aspects of life that make you an interesting and well-rounded student.</li>
            <li>If your first language is not English, describe any opportunities you have had to use English (such as an English-speaking school or work with a company that uses English).</li>
        </ul>
