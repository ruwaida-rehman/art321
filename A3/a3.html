        For this net art piece, I obtained the IP address of websites for 8 different nail salons located in Calgary. I then looked up each IP address to extract details such as the country where the ISP (Internet Service Provider) was based in. Within my dataset, I found that most websites (6 out of 8) were hosted by GoDaddy Inc. which is located in Arizona, United States. <br> <br>

        Next, I analyzed how many digits each IP address was made of and I found that most contained 10. I also noticed that not all IP addressâ€™s made it possible to retrieve the ISP postal code. Within my dataset, I was only able to find the postal code for 5 out of 8 nail salon websites. <br> <br>

        If I were to implement this net art piece fully, I would need to consider a larger set of nail salon websites. I would also analyze other IP address details such as hostname, ASN, ISP, organization, and network type. Below are some sketches that show how I obtained each IP address, extracted its details, and planned my work.
